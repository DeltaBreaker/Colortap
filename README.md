# Colortap~
Colortap records color data at specified locations to automate tasks.
This program works best when used in an environment that is constantly visually changing.

If you find an issue with the prorgam, post it at https://github.com/DeltaBreaker/Colortap/issues

Note:
	Requires Java 8 min.

For ADB mode:
	Make sure the Android sdk is installed

	The program will check in C:\Users\'user'\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools for adb.exe
	If it is installed elsewhere, start the server manually before opening Colortap

	By default, ADB is slower than desktop mode.
	If the option is available, set your Android resolution to as low as it can go for better performance.

Controls:

For Desktop mode:
	Stop input playback: Right click (anywhere)

	Add input to list: Middle click
